The solar PolArization and Directivity X-Ray Experiment is a NASA solar
mission led by the Space Sciences Laboratory at the University of California
Berkeley that launched on 23-Jun-2025 to study the acceleration mechanism in
solar flares. It consists of two x-ray instruments, the solar HARd x-ray Po-
larimeter (SHARP) and the Measuring Directivity to Determine Anisotropy
(MeDDEA) instrument. Funded by the Heliophysics Flight Opportunities in
Research and Technology Program (H-FORT) program, PADRE is a 12U space-
craft in a low-Earth orbit. The science goal of the
mission is investigate the dominant electron acceleration mechanisms in large
solar flares and its science objective is to determine the degree of beaming of
accelerated electrons in large solar flares. The two instruments achieve this objective and associated
requirement with two different but complimentary approaches. SHARP will de-
termine the degree of polarization of x-ray Bremsstrahlung photons to constrain
the electron pitch angle anisotropy. In coordination with Solar Orbiter
STIX, MeDDEA will determine the amount of X-ray Bremsstrahlung directiv-
ity. MeDDEA includes Solar Orbiter STIX spare Caliste-SO
detectors and will compare its spectral x-ray measurements with those taken by
STIX while at different heliographic angles. 

MeDDEA provides hard X-ray spectroscopy measurements with a full Sun
field of view. Unlike STIX is does not include imaging grids and therefore
produces only spectra and not images. It measures hard X-ray emission from
the Sun in the energy range of 5 to 100 keV, observing emission from both the
hot flare plasma in the solar corona as well as energetic electrons accelerated in
solar flares.

MeDDEA consists of 4 individual Caliste-SO detectors with 12 pixels each, 8 large pixels and 4 small pixels.
It records individual x-ray events, the time of arrival, energy and pixel number.
These data are downlinked on demand while an onboard process bins these data into individual spectra to provide summary data at a regular cadence.
