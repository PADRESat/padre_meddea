In the ideal case, every event in the Caliste-SO detectors is recorded.
At high rates, a decimation mechanism is applied to ensure that high energy events, which are less frequent than low energy events, are prioritized.
Decimation is defined by two quantities, the energy threshold and the fraction of events discarded.
