Data Description
----------------
MeDDEA has two primary science data products which originate from the same measurements.

#. an x-ray spectrum, provided regularly and 
#. a x-ray photon list provided on-demand.

Generally, the photon list data product will only be available during large flares and calibration periods.
It is generated automatically on board the spacecraft but only downloaded when requested.

MeDDEA also generates housekeeping data products.

All MeDDEA data will be made publicly available `here <https://umbra.nascom.nasa.gov/padre/padre-meddea/>`_.

Raw data consists of photon data, spectrum data, and housekeeping data in its raw binary form.
Level 0 data consists of the same data as the raw data but in fits files.
Each raw data file generates a single level 0 data file.
Level 1 data concatenate level 0 data files into daily files or flare files.

The data levels for the spectrum product are described below.
These products are processed on the ground using this Python package unless otherwise specified.

Calibrated data
---------------

Coming soon! The following is not yet implemented.


Both of the above products can be used to generate a calibrated spectrum product.

| Level    | Product                               | Description                           |

| 2        | Flux Spectrum in energy space,        | FITS, data flag to state if it was    |
|          | integrated over all detectors and     | generated from the photon list or not |
|          | pixels                                |                                       |

The above data product will be used to generate the following derived data products.

| Level    | Product                               | Description                           |      
+==========+=======================================+=======================================+
| 3        | Flare X-ray Directivity as a function | FITS file, requires Solar Orbiter STIX|
|          | of energy and time for the angular    | data, ratio of STIX to PADRE flux     |
|          | separation between STIX and PADRE     |                                       |
+----------+---------------------------------------+---------------------------------------+
| 4        | Flare-accelerated Electron Anisotropy | FITS file, requires modeling analysis |
|          | as a function of energy and time.     |                                       |
