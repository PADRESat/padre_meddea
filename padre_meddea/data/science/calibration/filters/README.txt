This directory contains the raw data files to be used for calibration purposes. 
The unfiltered and filtered measurements for each element of the optical path (i.e. the two 0.2 mm Aluminum and 1 mm Beryllium windows, and the thermal blanketing). 

Each filename contains the voltage and current settings used for each measurement, the type of measurement (i.e. filtered or unfiltered), and the ASIC corresponding to the window through which the measurements were made. 

Filenaming convention: 
YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_{minix voltage}kV_{Mini-X current}mA_Bewin{asic #}_{position #}.mca
